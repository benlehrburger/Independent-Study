# Generative AI: Empowering Creatives with Specialized Image and Language Models

I'll cut to the chase. Yes, generative AI is cool, and no, I don't think it's going destroy humanity.

I wanted to find some interesting applications of generative AI for my independent study in Cognitive Science @ Dartmouth College. Formally, my focus  area is "How can understanding the brain help us build better tools?" I have learned that Generative AI is a powerful application of brain-based software that affords incredible opportunities for creating tools that improve the human experience. Whether it's neurons or nodes, the emergent properties resulting from millions of finetuned dials never ceases to amaze me.

# Outputs

My best findings comprise the following tools. I cast a wide net into the pool of generative AI and only pursued what I perceived to be the most promising routes. Generative image and language tools have seen remarkable growth over the past couple years and are now open-source, generalizable, and customizable. Check out what I was able to create below.
